# Road-Accident-Data-Management-system

Goal - To enable efficient data management of daily occuring road accidents.


## Normalized OLTP database
1. I have developed normalized OLTP schema , created stored procedures to create those tables, initiated Python scripts for data validation checks and data ingestion into the tables. Created views and necessary SQL queries to understand the locations and impact of road accidents.

## OLAP Data Warehouse 
2. To perform historical analysis, OLAP data warehouse schema is designed and fact and dimension tables are created following a STAR schema. ETL tasks are automated by developing python scripts and ingested into the OLAP tables.

## NoSQL Database - MongoDB
3. A MongoDB database is also developed to understand the working and application of NoSQL database and enable faster querying.
